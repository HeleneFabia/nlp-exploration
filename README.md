I've always been fascinated by language. I studied languages at university and love to practice my foreign language skills when aborad. This curiosity of mine is also what brought me into the realms of computer languages (and hence, to my current job as an ML engineer). 

I currently work in the field of Computer Vision - however, due to my language affinity, I have also been always drawn to NLP. Since I spent most of my time last year working with images and CNNs, I wanted to dedicate the bgeinning of this year to re-freshing my NLP knowledge and dabbling into HuggingFace, SpaCy and nltk. 

## HuggingFace

[See my notebook here](https://github.com/HeleneFabia/nlp-exploration/blob/main/notebooks/nlp_with_huggingface.ipynb)

**What I learned:**
- pretraining and fine-tuning a language model with HuggingFace's Trainer API as well as with a custom trainer loop) (e.g. a translation model)
- evaluating a language model (e.g. using the BLEU score to evaluate a translation model)
- basic buildings blocks of transformer models
- basic workings of a tokenizer
  - normalization
  - pre-tokenization
  - tokenization-algorithms (e.g. BPE, WordPiece, Unigram)
  - decoding
  - padding and dynamic padding
  - truncation
  - special tokens
- pretraining and fine-tuning a tokenizer 
- types of model inputs (input IDs, token type IDs, attention masks, word IDs)
- running inference on HuggingFace's OTB models
- using HuggingFace's datasets library

## SpaCy

[See my notebook here](https://github.com/HeleneFabia/nlp-exploration/blob/main/notebooks/nlp_with_spacy.ipynb)

**What I learned:**
- pattern matching using spacy's Matcher and PhraseMatcher
- using spacy's trained pipeline packages
- accesing part-of-speech tags and dependency structures 
- using vocabs, Docs and Spans
-
